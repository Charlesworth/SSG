SSG - Static Site Generator
===

A Static Site Generator in ruby (so nothing new!). This is very much WIP and a hobby project so commits may be few and far between and the git history will be messy. Planned features:

- Primarily for use with my own, super simple markup syntax: WebSpeak
- Should work with Markdown (using the great Redcarpet gem)
- Will produce very simple websites with a generated index page
- Simple UI for site generation that anyone can use, will be a web page itself
- Theme-able: can use CSS theme packs

This project started off as a little project to produce a blog plugin for my already created website, rather than having to build my website around the blog.
