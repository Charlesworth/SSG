_________WebSpeak, my simple mark-up language

----------------
What is a mark-up language and WebSpeak?
Rather than writing your site in complex HTML, JavaScript and CSS code, you can use a mark-up language which uses simple tags and your written words. It is meant to add a layer of abstraction and simplicity to producing web content, rather than you having to learn to code.

WebSpeak is a simple mark-up language made for this site generator, I've made it to be very easy to use and quick to learn. **Name** also supports Markdown, the most popular mark-up language. Markdown has more functionality than WebSpeak but is a bit more to learn, so the choice is yours!
