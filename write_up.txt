_________WebSpeak, my simple mark-up language

----------------
What is a mark-up language and WebSpeak?
Rather than writing your website in complex code, using mark-up language your written words with some simple tags. It is meant to add a layer of abstraction and simplicity to producing web content, rather than you having to learn programming.

WebSpeak is a simple mark-up language made for this site generator, we have made it to be very easy to use and quick to learn. 


**Name** also supports Markdown, the most popular mark-up language. Markdown has more functionality than WebSpeak but is a bit more to learn, so the choice is yours!
